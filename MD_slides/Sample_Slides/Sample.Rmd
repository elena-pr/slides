## Reproducibility vs. Replicability

What exactly is reproducibility and how does it differ from replicability (which often gets most of the attention)?

--

.pull-left[
### Reproducibility:
- 'Can I **reproduce** your **workflow**?'.
- Goal: Integrity of the pipeline.
- Using **your** code and data to reproduce your **results**.
- Code that is:
  - Comprehensible
  - Traceable
  - Testable
]

--

.pull-right[
### Replicability:
- 'Can I **replicate** your **study**?'
- Goal: Accuracy of the science.
- Using **new** code, and possibly data, to re-conduct your **study**
- Replicability relies on strong reproducibility...
- ... without it, people don't know what you did!
- But replication is more expansive than reproduction.
