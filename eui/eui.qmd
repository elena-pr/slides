## Elections & Attitudes

<p style="font-size: 1.5em; text-align: center;">
  <strong>Voting</strong> [&#8594;]{.fragment} <em>Attitudes</em>
</p>

::: {.fragment}
- Electoral participation is equivalent to behaviourally committing to a political team. This commitment has the power to enhance attachment towards the chosen political team and animus towards political opponents (Dinas 2014; Sorace and Hobolt 2021).

## The Downstream Effects of Voting

Growing evidence that voting affects citizens:

- After voting for a party, voters tend to view that party more positively than before the election (Dinas 2014)  
- It influences citizens' presidential candidates' ratings (Mullainathan and Washington 2009) 
- First voting experiences have significant influence on future voting habits, vote choice, and turnout (Meredith 2009; Dinas 2014)  

::: {.fragment}
**But:** Evidence on desirable democratic outcomes is *mixed* — largely null effects on political knowledge, efficacy, and civic engagement (Holbein and Rangel 2020)
:::

::: {.fragment}
Taken together, these findings might suggest that voting's primary downstream effects may not be on *positive civic virtues*, but rather on citizens' **emotional relationships with political groups**.

## How? A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance

- Individuals experience mental discomfort when their behaviours are inconsistent with their beliefs (Festinger 1957).  
- To alleviate this discomfort, they may adjust their preferences to better align with their actions.  
- When individuals make a choice among a **limited set of alternatives**, they tend to develop a more favourable perception of their initially preferred option.  

::: {.fragment}
- How does this apply to elections?

## Can Elections Change Your Mind?

Under a group theory perspective, voting is a declaration of allegiance to a political group which shapes how citizens view themselves and their opponents.

**Evidence:**

- After voting for a party, voters tend to view that party more positively than before the election.  
- Citizens' levels of Partisan Identity (PID) become stronger among those who vote in alignment with a prior partisan leaning (Dinas 2014).  

::: {.fragment}
- **The Puzzle:** Does this mechanism also apply to animus towards political opponents?
:::

---

## From Dissonance to *Coherence*

Why first-time voters are crucial:

- Political science recognises the profound impact of initial political experiences on long-term behaviour (Campbell et al. 1960)  
- Cognitive dissonance in early voting experiences takes the form of *cognitive coherence*  
- For young citizens, dissonance may be small because it emerges from non-existing or weakly crystallised attitudes  

::: {.fragment}
The nexus: 
- The cost of changing their opinion is very low because they have no priors 
- Making voting becomes more consequential, more sticky - filling this attitudinal void

## An Illustrative Example

## What Are We Talking About?

- **Polarisation:** partisan gap in ideology and policy preference.  
  - In the US, Democrats adopting more extremely liberal positions and Republicans embracing more extremely conservative ones (Mason 2018).

::: {.fragment}
- **Affective Polarisation:** the acute tendency of partisans to view co-partisans positively and political opponents negatively.
:::

---

## Us vs. Them

**US** vs *THEM*?

- The United States: partisan divisions between **Republicans** and *Democrats* (Mason 2018).

## The Puzzle: Us vs. them, and them

**US** vs *THEM*?

- In multiparty systems, citizens might feel positively, or negatively, towards multiple parties at once (Reiljan 2020; Westwood et al. 2018; Wagner 2021).

## Data 1/2
**CSES (Wave 5): **

- Cross-national comparison

- *Running Variable:* Year of birth

- *Treatment:* Voting in previous salient election

- *Outcome:* Affective Polarisation and Partisanship 

- *Estimation:* 2SLS (optimal bandwidth) and robust bias-corrected inference (Calonico, Cattaneo and Titiunik, 2014)


## Data 2/2

**UKHLS: **

- Multiple Elections (2010, and 2019) and Party system transformation 

- *Running Variable:* Month and year of birth

- *Treatment:* Voting in current election

- *Outcome:* Affective Polarisation (3 vs. 6 parties)

- *Estimation:* 2SLS (optimal bandwidth) and robust bias-corrected inference 

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="untitled folder/wave_timeline.png" style="width: 45%;">
</div>

## Results: CSES

**Main Finding:** Voting in salient elections significantly increases affective polarization (both unweighted and weighted)

**Effect size:** 0.19-point increase in affective polarization, only marginally significant at 0.10 level when estimated with optimal bandwidth

## Overall

- Direction of the effect consistent across different datasets, estimations, and party configurations
- Stable across bandwidth sensitivity tests
- Pattern holds for both weighted and unweighted measures
- Effects tend to be significant when there are more parties in the game

## Discussion

**Preliminary Takeaways:**

- Behavioural commitment to a party might have the power to shape attitudes towards political opponents, but it does not necessarily make people feel closer to the chosen party.

::: {.fragment}

- It is possible that developing partisanship is a gradual, habitual process. In contrast, it requires less behavioural commitment to identify political opponents and foster negative feelings towards them.
:::

::: {.fragment}

Context matters: Effects conditional on party system structure — voting seems to produce polarisation in multi-party contexts but not in simpler two-party systems.
:::

:::{.fragment}

**Limitations:**

- Respondents' evaluations of parties as a measure of affective polarisation.
- Is this really about cognitive dissonance?
:::


## Going Forward

**Refining the Estimation:**

- Calculate ATT by dividing ITT by compliance rate using turnout data by age group
- Panel setup: differences in affective polarisation levels before and after the election

::: {.fragment}

**Understanding Mechanisms:**

- Examine consonant vs. dissonant voting patterns using panel data
- Investigate cumulative effects of repeated voting experiences
- Test whether voting for winning vs. losing party produces distinct outcomes

:::

:::{.fragment}
**Institutional variation:**

- Austria (voting age 16) and Brazil (compulsory 18-70, optional 16-17) and Germany (16-17 year-olds vote in municipal but not state/federal elections)

- Compulsory voting contexts: Australia, Belgium, Brazil
